Tips for losing weight
    - Studies have shown that the most effective way to lose weight is to do a LOW CARB diet. This means that you should try to avoid sugar and starch like bread, pasta, and potatoes. It's important to understand that just eating less and starving yourself doesn't necessarily mean that it will solve everything. A lot of the time, being hungry all the time will cause a normal person to give up and eat, hence the prevalence of the 'yoyo dieting'(losing, gaining, losing... weight dramatically). This can increase the risk of developing diabetes, heart diesease and cancer. Over-restricting your calories can slow down your metabolism and it can be hard on your brain, heart, liver and kidneys. So instead of doing 1000 calories a day and ditching all carbs, try the low car diet.
    - Doing more cardio increases your heart rate to burn more calories and strengthens your heart and lungs. There was a study done that 141 obese adults showed that combining 40 minutes of cardio 3 times per week with a weight loss diet decreased body weight by 9% over a six month period.
    - Cutting back on refined carbs is a simple way to improve the quality of your diet and further weight lose. Refined carbs high in calories and low in nutrients absorb quickly into bloodstream and causees blood sugar to spike and increase hunger.
    - Count your calories. You can use a calorie counter to see how many calories you should cut.
    - Eating more slowly is an effective strategy to decrease intake and enhance feelings of fullness.
    - Adding fiber to your diet helps to stabilize blood sugar, slow stomach emptyness and keep you feeling fuller longer. Multiple studies have shown that fiber helps with weight loss.
    - Eating a lot of vegetables is important because they are full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber with a low number of calories.

Tips for gaining weight
    - Although you might want to gain weight, it is important to keep in mind that eating a lot of processed food might help you gain weight, but it will destroy your health. If you want to gain weight, you might want to balance the amount of muslce mass and subcutaneous fat rather than a lot of unhealthy belly fat. By gaining weight the wrong way, normal or underweight people have a greater chance to get type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other health problems often associated with obesity.
    - Eating more calories than your body burns is very important. If you want to gain weight slowly and steady, aim for 300-500 calories more than you burn each day. Using a calorie calculator is a great idea to figure out how much you should eat and it will help you get an idea to get started losing weight.
    - The single most important nutrient for gaining healthy weight is protein. Muscle is made of protein and without it most of those extra calories may end up as body fat. Studies have shown that during periods of overfeeding, a high protein diet causes many of the extra calories to be turned into muscle. Some examples of high protein foods include meats, fish, eggs, many dairy products, legumes, nuts and others.
    - Eating frequently is key in this process. Eating 3 meals a day is important and adding energy snacks in between meals is highly encouraged.
